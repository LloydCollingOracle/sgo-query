<p>Provides models from which tables can be built.</p>
<p>Note that this package uses model implementations from the 
<a href="http://echo.nextapp.com">Echo3</a> project, which are fully
serializable, whereas Swing models are not.</p>
<p>This means that you need to have the Echo3-App jars in your maven
repository.  You will need to build these jars yourself from echo3
sources, since they are not in public maven repositories at the time
of writing.</p>
